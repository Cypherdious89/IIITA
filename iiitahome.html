		</p>
		<p>
			The new campus has been developed on 100 acres of land at Devghat, Jhalwa, on the outskirts of Allahabad. The architecture aims to transcend established design conventions and make a statement about the similarities between atoms and bits. Instead of the traditional geometric lines, the campus and other buildings have been styled on patterndeveloped by internationally acclaimed scholar and mathematician, Roger Penrose.
		</p>
		<h4>Penrose Geometry</h4>
		<p>
			This grid was chosen because the process of constructing a "Penrose Universe" has a remarkable congruence with the fundamentals of information theory. The basic units of information are aggregated in simple or complex sequences to provide a variety of "information structures" that span the entire range of human activity.
		</p>
		<h3>Elements of the new campus</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Within the Penrose layout for the campus, a central zone has been marked out for the academic core consisting of an administrative building, lecture theater complex,electronic library, computer laboratories and research facilities.
			</li>
			<li>The sun pattern has been chosen for laying out the library and the lecture hall complex. The computer laboratories and the administrative buildings are derived from selected 		tessellated blocks in the star pattern.
			</li>
